I purchased the green matrix 2416 from sure electronics, and was surprised to see it had its addresses arranged differently from version 1.0 "red" displays, and therefore showed mirrored information on the display. so with help from Arduino forums and little sleep was able to fix the "error". And now I am providing examples of this display in use for anyone who needs help in understanding and using this display in their projects
